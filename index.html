				<h3><a href="comic.html?comic=bravoman">Bravoman: Super Unequaled Hero of Excellence</a></h3>
				<p>Chouzetsu Rinjin Beraboh Man, or "Beraboh Man" for short, was released Japanese arcade exclusive in 1988. Localized as "Bravoman" for the Turbografx-16 for North America, Bravoman is available now on the Wii Shop Channel's Virtual Console in North America. The game follows a "salaryman" turned hero and is a parody of tokusatsu, video games, and 1980's otaku culture. Re-imagined with brand-new character designs, Bravoman is back as a hit webcomic written by Matt Moylan and drawn by Dax "D-Gee" Gordine.</p>

				<h3><a href="comic.html?comic=wondermomo">Wonder Momo</a></h3>
				<p>Wonder Momo was released in arcades in Japan in 1987. Ports include the PC-Engine (known as the Turbografx-16 outside Japan) and the Wii Shop Channel's Virtual Console, both of which are also Japan-only exclusives. A beat 'em up in the great tradition of 80s NAMCO titles, Wonder Momo now lives on as a ShiftyLook webcomic! Co-written by tokusatsu expert and super otaku Erik Ko and comic book veteran Jim Zub, the comic features the art of fighting games comic legend Omar Dogan.</p>
