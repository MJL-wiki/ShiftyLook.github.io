				<p>Dig Dug was released into arcades across the globe in 1982 and instantly became a worldwide hit. Ports include nearly every platform imaginable, and downloadable versions are available on all the current generation home consoles. The game pits Dig Dug against underground monsters known as Pooka and Fygar as he attempts to eliminate them through pump inflation or rock-crushing. In celebration of its 30th anniversary, ShiftyLook lined-up a mix of talent that included some of the very best in webcomics. Concluded at 34 episodes, Dig Dug will return with new comics this holiday season starting with Canadian Thanksgiving.</p>

				<h3><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140220181620/http://www.shiftylook.com:80/comics/galaga">Galaga</a></h3>
				<p>Released in 1981, Galaga is a fixed shooter arcade game that made the genre famous! It is now one of the most well known and loved arcade games in history. The player controls a space ship located at the bottom of the screen as enemy aliens fighters in the shape of "bugs" fill the upper portion and take turns firing at and dive-bombing the player's ship. Galaga has been ported to nearly every home gaming system as well as modern phones and tablets, and it's spawned more than sequels and remakes. Now Galaga has been re-imagined as a webcomic from three of the comic industry's top creators: written by Ryan North, illustrated by Chris Hastings, and colored by Anthony Clark.</p>

				<p>Tower of Babel is a puzzle/platformer in which the player assumes the role of famed archaeologist Dr. Borgnine. By moving and reorienting differently-shaped blocks, the player avoids enemies and creates stairways in an attempt to reach the 64th floor of the tower, where the fabled Hanging Gardens of Babylon are said to be found. First published by Namco in 1986 for the Family Computer, Nintendo later distributed it in arcades and, most recently, the title was included in the PlayStation release Namco Anthology 1.</p>
