				<h3><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140207233446/http://shiftylook.com/comics/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></h3>
				<p>Legend of the Valkyrie was released into Japanese arcades in 1989. An action adventure game, Valkyrie was ported to PC-Engine and Wii Shop Channel's Virtual console as Japan-only exclusives, but is available in English on Namco Musuem Volume 5 for the PlayStation. The new webcomic puts Valkyrie and Sandra in new adventures and is written and illustrated by Ashley Davis.</p>

				<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib0dAvQqmAA&list=PLNmM2dF5hFbl9Em6iDI-e_HKV3MmZwSjK">Tower of Babel</a></h3>
				<p>Tower of Babel is a puzzle/platformer in which the player assumes the role of famed archaeologist Dr. Borgnine. By moving and reorienting differently-shaped blocks, the player avoids enemies and creates stairways in an attempt to reach the 64th floor of the tower, where the fabled Hanging Gardens of Babylon are said to be found. First published by Namco in 1986 for the Family Computer, Nintendo later distributed it in arcades and, most recently, the title was included in the PlayStation release Namco Anthology 1.</p>
